# Frontend Application

This directory contains the frontend application for the SMS Gateway project. It is a React application built with Vite.

## Dockerization

To build and run the frontend application using Docker, follow these steps:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    Navigate to the `sms-gateway-project/frontend/` directory in your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker build -t sms-gateway-frontend .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    After building the image, you can run the container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 sms-gateway-frontend
    ```
    This will map port 80 of the container to port 80 on your host machine. You can then access the application in your browser at `http://localhost`.
